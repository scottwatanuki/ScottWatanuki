### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Scott Watanuki, and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in Computer Science with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Systems Architecture.

I am currently in search for a summer 2023 software engineering internship.

I work as a Software Engineer Intern at GL Navigation and also serve as the Senior Vice President of Technology at Big Data Big Impact.
In the past, Iâ€™ve created an AI model to diagnose cataracts, built software to optimize sleep schedules according to sleep chronotypes, programmed software to develop personalized planners for students, and managed an app with 1500 daily active users.

Through the Stanford e-Entrepreneurship program, I have led a team of four to win a startup pitch competition evaluated by Venture Capitalists from Silicon Valley. 

I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and its potential to change lives and create meaningful impacts on a large scale. That is why software, innovation, and entrepreneurship are at the core of what I do.

Please get in touch with me for further information or if youâ€™d like to work on a cool project/startup with me!
