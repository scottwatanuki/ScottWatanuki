### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Scott, and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in Computer Science with concentrations in Systems Architecture and Artificial Intelligence. Iâ€™m currently looking for a summer 2023 software engineering internship.

I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and its potential to change lives and create meaningful impacts on a large scale. That is why software, innovation, and entrepreneurship are at the core of what I do.

Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to work on a cool project with me or for anything else!
